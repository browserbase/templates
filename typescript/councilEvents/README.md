# Stagehand + Browserbase: Council Events Automation

## AT A GLANCE
- Goal: demonstrate how to automate event information extraction from Philadelphia Council.
- Navigation & Search: automate website navigation, calendar selection, and year filtering.
- Data Extraction: extract structured event data with validated output using Zod schemas.
- Practical Example: extract council events with name, date, and time information.

- extract: pull structured data from web pages into validated objects.
  Docs â†’ https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/extract
- schema: a Zod definition that enforces data types, optional fields, and validation rules.
  Docs â†’ https://zod.dev/
- council events automation: navigate to council website, select calendar, and extract event information.
- structured data extraction: convert unstructured web content into typed, validated objects.

## QUICKSTART
 1) cd councilEvents
 2) npm install
 3) cp ../../.env.example .env (or create .env with BROWSERBASE_API_KEY)
 4) Add your Browserbase API key to .env
 5) npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Navigates to Philadelphia Council website
- Clicks calendar from the navigation menu
- Selects 2025 from the month dropdown
- Extracts structured event data including name, date, and time
- Returns typed object with event information

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "Cannot find module 'dotenv'": ensure npm install ran successfully
- Missing API key: verify .env is loaded and file is not committed
- Events not found: check if the website structure has changed or if no events exist for the selected period
- Schema validation errors: ensure extracted data matches Zod schema structure

## USE CASES
â€¢ Event tracking: automate monitoring of council meetings and public events.
â€¢ Calendar aggregation: collect event information for integration with calendar systems.
â€¢ Public information access: extract structured event data for citizens and researchers.
â€¢ Meeting scheduling: track upcoming council meetings for attendance planning.

## NEXT STEPS
â€¢ Date filtering: make the year or date selection configurable via environment variables or prompts.
â€¢ Multi-year extraction: extend the flow to extract events from multiple years in parallel.
â€¢ Calendar integration: add logic to export extracted events to calendar formats (iCal, Google Calendar).
â€¢ Event notifications: add logic to send alerts for upcoming meetings or important events.
