- schema: a Zod definition that enforces data types, optional fields, and validation rules.
  Docs â†’ https://zod.dev/
- market research automation: navigate to prediction markets, search for specific topics, and extract current odds.
- structured data extraction: convert unstructured web content into typed, validated objects.

## QUICKSTART
 1) cd polymarket-research
 2) npm install
 3) cp ../../.env.example .env (or create .env with BROWSERBASE_API_KEY)
 4) Add your Browserbase API key to .env
 5) npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Navigates to Polymarket prediction market website
- Searches for specified market query
- Selects the first search result
- Extracts structured market data including odds, prices, and volume
- Returns typed object with market information

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "Cannot find module 'dotenv'": ensure npm install ran successfully
- Missing API key: verify .env is loaded and file is not committed
- Search results not found: check if the market exists or if website structure has changed
- Schema validation errors: ensure extracted data matches Zod schema structure

## USE CASES
â€¢ Market tracking: automate monitoring of prediction market odds for specific events or topics.
â€¢ Research aggregation: collect current prices and volume data from multiple prediction markets.
â€¢ Trading automation: extract structured market data for integration with trading or analysis systems.
â€¢ Sentiment analysis: track how prediction markets assess the likelihood of future events.

## NEXT STEPS
â€¢ Parameterize search queries: make the search term configurable via environment variables or prompts.
â€¢ Multi-market extraction: extend the flow to search and extract data from multiple markets in parallel.
â€¢ Historical tracking: persist extracted data over time to track market movement and trends.
â€¢ Price alerts: add logic to monitor specific price thresholds and send notifications.
