# Stagehand + Browserbase: AI-Powered Date Planner (TypeScript)

## AT A GLANCE
- Goal: Find personalized restaurant recommendations and plan the perfect date using AI-powered search and scoring.
- AI Integration: Uses OpenAI to generate search queries and score restaurants based on user preferences.
- Web-Wide Search: Searches Google to find restaurants across multiple platforms (OpenTable, Yelp, Resy, restaurant websites, etc.).
- Click-Through Verification: Visits restaurant pages directly to verify details, check availability, and extract comprehensive information.
- Concurrent Sessions: Runs multiple browser sessions simultaneously to search different queries in parallel.

- concurrent sessions: run multiple browser sessions simultaneously for faster searching

## QUICKSTART
1) cd typescript/date-planner
2) npm install
3) cp .env.example .env
4) Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and OpenAI API key to .env
5) npm run dev

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Prompts user for date preferences, cuisine, location, budget, and special requirements
- Generates search queries using OpenAI based on user input
- Runs concurrent browser sessions to search the web via Google
- Extracts restaurant links from search results across multiple platforms
- Clicks through to restaurant pages to verify details (rating, price, cuisine, hours, contact info, reservations)
- Extracts comprehensive restaurant information from individual pages
- AI-scores restaurants based on user preferences (only recommends restaurants scoring 5/10 or higher that match cuisine)
- Displays verified restaurant details including address, phone, hours, and reservation availability
- Suggests nearby activities to extend the date
- Displays comprehensive date plan with primary restaurant, backups, and activities

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via npm
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required API keys
- Search failures: check internet connection and website accessibility
- Import errors: ensure TypeScript is properly configured
- Reservation failures: some restaurants may require manual booking
