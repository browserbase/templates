/**
 * Data-driven OnlineMind2Web agent eval
 * - Expects per-test params injected via eval runner: { task_id, confirmed_task, website, reference_length, level }
 * - Starts at `website`, runs the agent with `confirmed_task` as instruction
 * - Requires the agent to output a final answer in the form: "Final Answer: <value>"
 * - Marks success if such an answer string is present (exact matching against dataset can be layered later)
 * - Uses the evaluator to determine if the agent successfully completed the task
