# Stagehand + Browserbase: Context Authentication Example

## AT A GLANCE
- Goal: demonstrate persistent authentication using Browserbase **contexts** that survive across sessions.
- Flow: create context â†’ log in once â†’ persist cookies/tokens â†’ reuse context in a new session â†’ extract data â†’ clean up.
- Benefits: skip re-auth on subsequent runs, reduce MFA prompts, speed up protected flows, and keep state stable across retries.

## GLOSSARY
- context: a persistent browser state (cookies, localStorage, cache) stored server-side and reusable by new sessions.
  Docs â†’ https://docs.browserbase.com/features/contexts
- persist: when true, any state changes during a session are written back to the context for future reuse.
- act: perform UI actions from a prompt (click, type, navigate).
  Docs â†’ https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/act

## QUICKSTART
 1) cd context-template
 2) npm install
 3) npm install axios
 4) cp .env.example .env
 5) Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and SF Rec Park credentials to .env
 6) npm start

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Creates context, performs login, saves auth state
- Reuses context in new session to access authenticated pages
- Extracts user data using structured schemas
- Cleans up context after completion

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "Cannot find module": ensure all dependencies are installed
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required variables
- Context persistence: ensure persist: true is set to save login state

## USE CASES
â€¢ Persistent login sessions: Automate workflows that require authentication without re-logging in every run.
â€¢ Access to gated content: Crawl or extract data from behind login walls (e.g., booking portals, dashboards, intranets).
â€¢ Multi-step workflows: Maintain cookies/tokens across different automation steps or scheduled jobs.

## NEXT STEPS
â€¢ Extend to multiple apps: Reuse the same context across different authenticated websites within one session.
â€¢ Add session validation: Extract and verify account info (e.g., username, profile details) to confirm successful auth.
â€¢ Secure lifecycle: Rotate, refresh, and delete contexts programmatically to enforce security policies.
