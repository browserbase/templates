  Docs â†’ https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/extract
- license verification: process of confirming the validity and status of professional licenses.

## QUICKSTART
 1) cd validate-nurses
 2) python -m venv venv
 3) source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
 4) pip install stagehand python-dotenv pydantic
 5) cp .env.example .env
 6) Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and OpenAI API key to .env
 7) python main.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Initializes Stagehand session with Browserbase
- Loops through license records in LICENSE_RECORDS array
- For each record: navigates to verification site, fills form, searches
- Extracts verification results: name, license number, status, info URL
- Displays structured JSON output with all verification results
- Provides live session URL for monitoring
- Closes session cleanly

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID, BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, and OPENAI_API_KEY
- No results found: check if license numbers are valid or if verification site structure has changed
- Network issues: ensure internet access and verification sites are accessible
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one

## USE CASES
â€¢ HR compliance: Automate license verification for healthcare staff onboarding and annual reviews.
â€¢ Healthcare staffing: Verify credentials of temporary or contract nurses before assignment.
â€¢ Regulatory reporting: Collect license status data for compliance reporting and audits.

## NEXT STEPS
â€¢ Multi-site support: Add support for different license verification sites and adapt form filling logic.
â€¢ Batch processing: Load license records from CSV/Excel files for large-scale verification.
â€¢ Status monitoring: Set up scheduled runs to track license status changes and expiration dates.
