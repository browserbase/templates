## QUICKSTART
1) Create an account with SF Recreation & Parks website -> https://www.rec.us/organizations/san-francisco-rec-park
2) Create virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3) Install dependencies:
   pip install stagehand python-dotenv InquirerPy pydantic
4) Create .env with:
   BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
   BROWSERBASE_API_KEY=...
   SF_REC_PARK_EMAIL=...
   SF_REC_PARK_PASSWORD=...
5) Run:
   python index.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Prompts user for activity type (Tennis/Pickleball), date, and time
- Automates login to SF Recreation & Parks booking system
- Filters courts by activity, date, and time preferences
- Extracts available court information and displays options
- Automates court booking with verification code handling
- Confirms successful booking with details

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains all required API keys and SF Rec Park login
- Login failures: check SF Rec Park credentials and account status
- Booking errors: verify court availability and booking system accessibility
- Verification codes: ensure you can receive SMS/email codes for booking confirmation
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one

## FURTHER USE CASES
‚Ä¢ Court Booking: Automate tennis and pickleball court reservations in San Francisco
‚Ä¢ Recreation & ticketing: courts, parks, events, museum passes, campsite reservations

‚Ä¢ Swap the target site: point the script at a different booking or reservation portal (e.g., gyms, coworking, campsites)
‚Ä¢ Generalize filters: extend date/time/activity prompts to handle more categories or custom filters
‚Ä¢ Automate recurring bookings: wrap the script in a scheduler (cron/queue) to secure slots automatically
‚Ä¢ Add notifications: send booking confirmations to Slack, email, or SMS once a reservation succeeds
‚Ä¢ Handle multi-user accounts: support multiple credentials so a team can share automation
‚Ä¢ Export structured results: save court/slot data as JSON, CSV, or push to a database for reporting
‚Ä¢ Integrate with APIs: connect confirmed reservations to a calendar system (Google Calendar, Outlook)
‚Ä¢ Enhance verification flow: add support for automatically fetching OTP codes from email/SMS inboxes
‚Ä¢ Improve resilience: add retries, backoff, and selector caching to handle UI changes gracefully
‚Ä¢ Template it: strip out "pickleball" wording and reuse as a boilerplate for any authenticate ‚Üí filter ‚Üí extract ‚Üí book workflow
