 3) source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
 4) pip install stagehand python-dotenv pydantic
 5) cp .env.example .env

- Selects 2025 events from dropdown
- Extracts event names, dates, and times
- Displays structured JSON output with all events
- Provides live session URL for monitoring

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID, BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, and OPENAI_API_KEY
- No events found: check if the website structure has changed or if 2025 calendar is available
- Network issues: ensure internet access and phila.legistar.com is accessible
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one
