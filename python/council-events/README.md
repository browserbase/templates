## AT A GLANCE

- Flow: navigate to phila.legistar.com → click calendar → select 2025 → extract event data (name, date, time).
- Benefits: quickly gather upcoming council events without manual browsing, structured data ready for analysis or notifications.

- extract: pull structured data from a page using AI and Pydantic schemas.
  Docs → https://docs.stagehand.dev/basics/extract
- Pydantic schema: type-safe data models that validate extracted content.

## QUICKSTART
 1) cd council-events
 2) python -m venv venv
 3) source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
 4) pip install stagehand python-dotenv pydantic
 5) cp .env.example .env
 6) Add your Browserbase API key, Project ID, and OpenAI API key to .env
 7) python main.py

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
- Initializes Stagehand session with Browserbase
- Navigates to Philadelphia Council calendar
- Selects 2025 events from dropdown
- Extracts event names, dates, and times
- Displays structured JSON output with all events
- Provides live session URL for monitoring
- Closes session cleanly

## COMMON PITFALLS
- "ModuleNotFoundError": ensure all dependencies are installed via pip
- Missing credentials: verify .env contains BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID, BROWSERBASE_API_KEY, and OPENAI_API_KEY
- No events found: check if the website structure has changed or if 2025 calendar is available
- Network issues: ensure internet access and phila.legistar.com is accessible
- Import errors: activate your virtual environment if you created one

## USE CASES
• Civic monitoring: Track upcoming council meetings, hearings, and votes for advocacy or journalism.
• Event aggregation: Pull council calendars into dashboards, newsletters, or community notification systems.
• Research & analysis: Collect historical event data to analyze meeting frequency, topics, or scheduling patterns.

## NEXT STEPS
• Multi-year extraction: Loop through multiple years to build historical event database.
• Event details: Click into individual events to extract agendas, attendees, and documents.
• Notifications: Set up scheduled runs to detect new events and send alerts via email/Slack.
